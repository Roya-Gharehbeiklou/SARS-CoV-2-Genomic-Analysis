## What You Can Expect

### **Outputs of the Project**

1. **Enhanced R Skills**: By completing tasks, youâ€™ll gain confidence in creating R scripts, working with data structures, applying control flows, and performing text processing.

2. **Sequence Transformations**: Generate and analyze DNA and RNA sequences by creating reverse, complement, and reverse-complement versions of genomic data. Example outcomes include:
   - A DNA sequence transformation where a sequence like `ATCG` becomes:
     - Reverse: `GCTA`
     - Complement: `TAGC`
     - Reverse-Complement: `CGAT`
   - Similar transformations for RNA sequences.

3. **Text Processing Insights**: Extract meaningful information from genomic text files and visualize patterns in processed text or sequences.

4. **Genomic Analysis**:
   - Insights into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including identifying patterns and performing sequence-based calculations.
   - Statistical outputs summarizing genomic data.

5. **Visualizations**: Generate charts, such as:
   - Histograms showing sequence length distributions.
   - Bar plots of base frequencies in DNA or RNA.
   - Word clouds for analyzing text or sequence-related patterns.
